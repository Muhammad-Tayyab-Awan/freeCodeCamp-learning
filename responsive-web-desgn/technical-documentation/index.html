        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web
          pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been
          adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern
          web applications possible that is, applications with which you can
          interact directly without doing a page reload for every action.
          JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide
          various forms of interactivity and cleverness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with
          the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by
          marketing considerations rather than good judgment. When JavaScript
          was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and
          was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good idea to try to
          ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.
        </p>
        <p>
          After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was
          written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so
          that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript
          could make sure they actually provided the same language. This is
          called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International
          organization that conducted the standardization. In practice, the
          terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably they are
          two names for the same language.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of
          these things are true. When I was required to write something in
          JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to despise it. It would
          accept almost anything I typed but interpret it in a way that was
          completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do with the
          fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there
          is a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it
          allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming
          in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes
          finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not
          point them out to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This flexibility also has its advantages, though. It leaves room for
          techniques that are impossible in more rigid languages and makes for a
          pleasant, informal style of programming. After learning the language
          properly and working with it for a while, I have come to actually like
          JavaScript
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript version 3
          was the widely supported version during JavaScript&apos;s ascent to
          dominance, roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was
          underway on an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical
          improvements and extensions to the language. Changing a living, widely
          used language in such a radical way turned out to be politically
          difficult, and work on version 4 was abandoned in 2008. A much less
          ambitious version 5, which made only some uncontroversial
          improvements, came out in 2009. In 2015, version 6 came out, a major
          update that included some of the ideas planned for version 4. Since
          then we&apos;ve had new, small updates every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that JavaScript is evolving means that browsers have to
          constantly 6 keep up. If you&apos;re using an older browser, it may
          not support every feature. The language designers are careful to not
          make any changes that could break existing programs, so new browsers
          can still run old programs. In this book, I&apos;m using the 2024
          version of JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Code, and what to do with it</h3>
        <p>
          Code is the text that makes up programs. Most chapters in this book
          contain quite a lot of code. I believe reading code and writing code
          are indispensable parts of learning to program. Try to not just glance
          over the examples—read them attentively and understand them. This may
          be slow and confusing at first, but I promise that you&apos;ll quickly
          get the hang of it. The same goes for the exercises. Don&apos;t assume
          you understand them until you&apos;ve actually written a working
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recommend you try your solutions to exercises in an actual
          JavaScript interpreter. That way, you&apos;ll get immediate feedback
          on whether what you are doing is working, and, I hope, you&apos;ll be
          tempted to experiment and go beyond the exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to run the example code in the book—and to experiment
          with it is to look it up in the online version of the book at
          https://eloquentjavascript.net. There, you can click any code example
          to edit and run it and to see the output it produces. To work on the
          exercises, go to https://eloquentjavascript.net/ code, which provides
          starting code for each coding exercise and allows you to look at the
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running the programs defined in this book outside of the books website
          requires some care. Many examples stand on their own and should work
          in any JavaScript environment. But code in later chapters is often
          written for a specific environment (the browser or Node.js) and can
          run only there. In addition, many chapters define bigger programs, and
          the pieces of code that appear in them depend on each other or on
          external files. The sandbox on the website provides links to ZIP files
          containing all the scripts and data files necessary to run the code
          for a given chapter.

        <h3>Defining & Using Variables</h3>
        <p>
          Variables are what make up most of JavaScript. These variables make up
          things from numbers to objects, which are all over JavaScript to make
          one's life much easier.
        </p>
        <code
          >var myVariable = "This is a variable!";<span class="copy"
            >Copy</span
          ></code
        >
        <p>
          This is an example of defining variables. This variable is called a
          "string" because it has ASCII characters (A-Z, 0-9, !@#$, etc.)
        </p>
        <code>
          var number1 = 5;
          <br />
          number1 = 3;
          <span class="copy">Copy</span>
        </code>
        <p>
          Here, we defined a number called "number1" which was equal to 5.
          However, on the second line, we changed the value to 3. To show the
          value of a variable, we log it to the console or use window.alert();
        </p>
        <code>
          console.log(number1); // 3
          <br />
          window.alert(number1); // 3
          <span class="copy">Copy</span>
        </code>
        <p>To add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc., we do like so:</p>
        <code
          >number1 = number1 + 5; // 3 + 5 = 8
          <br />
          number1 = number1 - 6; // 8 - 6 = 2
          <br />
          var number2 = number1 * 10; // 2 (times) 10 = 20
          <br />
          var number3 = number2 / number1; // 20 (divided by) 2 = 10;
          <span class="copy">Copy</span></code
        >
        <p>
          We can also add strings which will concatenate them, or put them
          together. For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >var myString = "I am a " + "string!"; // "I am a string!"<span
            class="copy"
            >Copy</span
          ></code
        >
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>
          To add annotations, hints, or exclude some code from being executed
          JavaScript provides two ways of commenting code lines
